# basic-css-grid

## Overview
This is a CSS snippet for use with [Obsidian][obsidian]. This adds columns 
and other grid-oriented options to the callout functionality when designing 
notes.

## How to Use
1. Copy the `callout-grid-2.1.css` file into your Obsidian vault's 
`.obsidian/snippets` directory.
2. Enable the snippet in **Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets**

## Documentation and Origin
This stylesheet is pulled from [this post][forum-post] on the 
[Obsidian forums][forums]. I strongly recommend perusing the post as it 
provides all the information normally relegated to a README and is quite 
comprehensive.

Special thanks to [Wendystraite][wendystraite] for developing this snippet.
